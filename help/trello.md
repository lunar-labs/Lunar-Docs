## Trello

This is our quick introduction to our Trello board, where you can find all reported bugs or proposals:

* Here is our Trello board: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/2eELnPx7/lunar-discord)

On our Trello board you can find many categories that shows you the progress of bugreports and proposals from you and others.

The Trello board is in **view only** mode, because it updates on every change of any bugreport or proposal automatically.

Feel free to search your topic on our Trello board to prevent duplicated bugreports and suggestions.
