# Lunar - Discord Bot

**Welcome on the Documentation of Lunar!**

Lunar was created on **4th February 2019**. Since then we have released over **150** updates and spent over **100** hours making the bot more user-friendly than any other bot!

Our goal was and still is, to provide every botuser an all-in bot so he doesn't have to invite 10 other bots for all the features that he wants to have on his discord server.

We released our own [**website** ](http://lunar-labs.io)including the dashboard on **Launch** and it offers you a place where you can set up almost all settings of the bot via your browser!

If you are a **new** user of Lunar, I would advise you to read on

so that you will **quickly** become familiar with Lunar!
